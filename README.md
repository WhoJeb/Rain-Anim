## Compiling From Source
If somehow by some divine intervention you find this repo and are bat-shit insane enough actually want to compile it yourself, here are some things you should know:

  1. It is only easy to do on NixOS
  2. You will need all the dependancies in [shell.nix] to be installed globally or you will have to mess with the makefile and/or environment variables to point to the right spot
